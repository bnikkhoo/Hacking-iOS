// Problem 4
//A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

var largest = 0

for num1 in stride(from: 999, to: 100, by: -1) {
    for num2 in stride(from: num1-1, to: 900, by: -1) {
        var product = num1 * num2
        if String(product) == String((String(product)).characters.reversed()) && product > largest { largest = product }
    }
}

print(largest)


// Answer using a reverse function - actually slower than the string function above!
